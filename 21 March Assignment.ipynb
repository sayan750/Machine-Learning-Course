    "Ordinal Encoding and Label Encoding are both techniques used to convert categorical data into numerical data for use in machine learning models. However, they differ in the way they assign numerical values to the categories.\n",
    "\n",
    "Ordinal Encoding is a technique that assigns a unique numerical value to each category in a way that preserves the order of the categories. For example, in the case of T-shirt sizes, \"small\", \"medium\", and \"large\" could be assigned values of 1, 2, and 3 respectively. This encoding is useful when there is a clear ordering of the categories, but the actual numerical values don't matter as much as the relative order between them.\n",
    "\n",
    "Label Encoding, on the other hand, assigns a unique numerical value to each category without regard for the order of the categories. For example, in the case of fruit types, \"apple\", \"banana\", and \"orange\" could be assigned values of 1, 2, and 3 respectively. This encoding is useful when there is no clear order to the categories.\n",
    "\n",
    "In general, Ordinal Encoding is preferred when there is a clear ordering to the categories, while Label Encoding is preferred when there is no clear ordering. However, it's important to note that both techniques have limitations and may not be suitable for all types of data.\n",
    "\n",
    "As an example, if you are working with a dataset of customer feedback on a product where the feedback is categorized as \"positive\", \"neutral\", and \"negative\", you might choose Ordinal Encoding because there is a clear ordering to the categories that can be preserved with numerical values. On the other hand, if you are working with a dataset of different types of music genres, you might choose Label Encoding because there is no clear ordering to the categories."

    "Target Guided Ordinal Encoding is a feature engineering technique that is used to transform categorical variables into numerical ones based on the relationship between the variable and the target variable. The basic idea behind Target Guided Ordinal Encoding is to assign a numerical value to each category of a categorical variable based on the mean of the target variable for that category. The categories with the highest mean of the target variable are assigned a higher value than the categories with the lowest mean.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, let's say we have a dataset with a categorical variable 'color' and a target variable 'price'. We want to predict the price of a product based on its color. We can use Target Guided Ordinal Encoding to transform the 'color' variable into a numerical variable that represents the relationship between color and price.\n",
    "\n",
    "To do this, we first calculate the mean price for each color. We then assign a numerical value to each color based on its mean price. For example, if the mean price for red products is higher than the mean price for blue products, we can assign a higher value to red and a lower value to blue. We can then use this transformed feature as input to our machine learning model."

    "Covariance is a statistical measure that describes the relationship between two variables. It measures how much two variables change together. Specifically, it measures the extent to which two variables move in the same direction (a positive covariance) or in opposite directions (a negative covariance).\n",
    "\n",
    "In statistical analysis, covariance is important because it helps researchers understand how different variables are related. It is particularly useful when researchers are trying to understand the relationship between two variables, such as the relationship between education level and income. By calculating the covariance between these two variables, researchers can determine whether there is a strong or weak relationship between them, and whether the relationship is positive or negative.\n",
    "\n",
    "Covariance is calculated using the following formula:\n",
    "\n",
    "cov(X,Y) = Σ(x_i - μ_x)(y_i - μ_y)/(n-1)\n",
