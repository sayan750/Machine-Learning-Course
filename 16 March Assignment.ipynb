    "1. Increase the size of the training dataset: A larger dataset provides more examples of the underlying patterns and reduces the chances of overfitting.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Use simpler models: Models that are too complex may overfit the training data, so it is often better to use simpler models with fewer parameters.\n",

    "Underfitting occurs in machine learning when a model is too simple to capture the underlying pattern in the data, resulting in poor performance on both the training and test sets. It typically occurs when the model is not complex enough to represent the data accurately.\n",

Using a low-capacity neural network to fit a complex dataset: Neural networks with few hidden layers or neurons have low capacity, meaning they may not be able to capture complex patterns in the data.

    "The bias-variance tradeoff is a fundamental concept in machine learning that describes the relationship between the complexity of a model and its ability to generalize to new data. In short, the tradeoff refers to the problem of balancing the accuracy of a model with its ability to generalize to new, unseen data.\n",

    "Bias refers to the error that is introduced by approximating a real-world problem with a simplified model. A model with high bias will underfit the data and perform poorly on both the training data and new, unseen data. On the other hand, variance refers to the amount by which the model's predictions vary for different training sets. A model with high variance will overfit the data and perform well on the training data but poorly on new, unseen data.\n",

    "The relationship between bias and variance can be visualized as a U-shaped curve. At one end of the curve, a model is underfitting, meaning that it has high bias and low variance. At the other end of the curve, a model is overfitting, meaning that it has low bias and high variance. The optimal point on the curve is the point where the model has a balance of bias and variance that allows it to generalize well to new, unseen data.\n",

Regularization techniques such as L1 or L2 regularization can be used to control the complexity of a model and help prevent overfitting."

    "Overfitting occurs when a machine learning model learns the training data too well, capturing the noise and idiosyncrasies of the data and failing to generalize to new, unseen data. Underfitting, on the other hand, occurs when the model is too simple and fails to capture the underlying patterns in the data, resulting in poor performance on both the training and test data. Here are some common methods for detecting overfitting and underfitting in machine learning models:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Train-Validation-Test Split: A simple way to detect overfitting is to split the data into three sets: training, validation, and test. The model is trained on the training set and its performance is evaluated on the validation set. If the performance on the validation set is significantly worse than the performance on the training set, it may be overfitting. The model can then be adjusted until the performance on the validation set is satisfactory. Once the model is finalized, it is evaluated on the test set to ensure that it generalizes well.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Learning Curves: Learning curves plot the performance of the model on the training and validation sets as a function of the number of training examples. If the model is overfitting, the performance on the training set will continue to improve while the performance on the validation set will plateau or even worsen. If the model is underfitting, the performance on both sets will be poor and will improve with more training examples.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Regularization: Regularization techniques such as L1/L2 regularization, dropout, or early stopping can be used to prevent overfitting. Regularization adds a penalty term to the loss function that encourages the model to have smaller weights, reducing the complexity of the model and preventing it from overfitting.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Cross-Validation: Cross-validation is a technique for estimating the performance of a model by partitioning the data into several subsets and training and testing the model on different subsets. If the model performs well on all subsets, it is likely not overfitting or underfitting.\n",
    "\n",
    "To determine whether a model is overfitting or underfitting, one can use the above techniques. If the model is overfitting, one can try to reduce the complexity of the model by using regularization or reducing the number of features. If the model is underfitting, one can try increasing the complexity of the model by adding more features or increasing the number of hidden layers. It is important to strike a balance between model complexity and performance on the validation set, to ensure that the model generalizes well to new, unseen data."

For example, linear regression models can have high bias if the data has a non-linear relationship. High bias models tend to have low complexity and high stability, meaning they are less sensitive to changes in the data. They may also have lower variance and may generalize well to new data.\n",
    "\n",
    "High variance models, on the other hand, are complex models that fit the training data too closely and may not be able to generalize to new data. Examples of high variance models include decision trees with too many branches or neural networks with too many hidden layers. High variance models tend to have low stability, meaning they are more sensitive to changes in the data. They may also have higher bias, and thus may not accurately represent the underlying data.\n",

    "In machine learning, regularization is a technique used to prevent overfitting, a problem where a model is trained to fit the training data so well that it fails to generalize well to new, unseen data. Regularization methods add additional constraints to the learning process, which helps to reduce the model's tendency to overfit to the training data.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are several common regularization techniques used in machine learning, including:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. L1 regularization (Lasso): This method adds a penalty term to the cost function of the model that is proportional to the absolute value of the weights. It encourages the model to have sparse feature representations, where some features have a weight of zero. This can be useful in feature selection tasks.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. L2 regularization (Ridge): This method adds a penalty term to the cost function that is proportional to the square of the weights. This encourages the model to have small weight values for all features, which helps to prevent overfitting.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Dropout: This method randomly drops out (sets to zero) a fraction of the units in a neural network during training. This encourages the network to learn redundant representations of the data, making it more robust to overfitting.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Early stopping: This method stops the training process early, before the model has had a chance to overfit to the training data. This is done by monitoring the performance of the model on a separate validation set, and stopping training when the validation performance stops improving.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Data augmentation: This method artificially increases the size of the training set by applying transformations to the data, such as rotation, scaling, or flipping. This helps to reduce overfitting by exposing the model to more variations of the data.\n",
